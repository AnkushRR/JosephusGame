# JosephusGame
A simple Game inspired by Josephus Problem
...............................................................................................................................

You may be aware of Josephus problem where people are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a 
specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people 
are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person,
going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.

In this application "Josephus Game" there is no specific number by which people are skipped.
Also,no person is killed or freed :). Instead of people, this app uses eggs carrying a random values, all to be unlocked in 
consecutive order, but alternatively by each player. The values on the eggs gets added to it's unlocker's score.
As all the the values of 45 eggs are randomized every time(at the time of unlocking) There is pure uncertainity of who will
win the game!
